### About Me:

My name is Andrey, I am 45 years old. I am currently actively developing in the direction of web development. I have always liked to understand how websites are structured from the inside, so I try to take courses in HTML, CSS and JS and continue to independently study modern frontend technologies.

The goal is to find a remote job in IT to combine a flexible schedule with interesting projects and a stable income.

Ready to learn new things, develop as a specialist and be useful in the team.
